I am postdoctoral fellow in the lab of Rui Costa <a href="https://www.actingbrain.com/alice-mosberger"> (actingbrain.com) </a>
at the  <a href="https://zuckermaninstitute.columbia.edu/"> Zuckerman Institute </a> at Columbia University.

My goal is to gain a circuit-level understanding of how skilled actions are learned. I am particularly interested in how the brain establishes a causal relationship between actions and their outcomes, allowing the reselection of exploratory movements and their refinement into skills through reinforcement mechanisms.

My interest in this interplay between motivational and motor systems began during my graduate work (ETH Zurich, Switzerland) where I studied the recovery of skilled reaching in rats after spinal cord injury and stroke. I gained my PhD in Biology for uncovering anatomical and functional reorganization of the corticospinal tract that underlie forelimb recovery, and showing that motivation strongly affects skilled reaching speed and accuracy.

In my current work as a postdoc in Rui Costaâ€™s lab, I investigate how novel skilled actions are refined through outcome reinforcement of an action endpoint. I have developed a rich and versatile forelimb joystick task for mice to address this question at the circuit level, starting with the forelimb sensorimotor corticostriatal circuit, using imaging and optogenetic approaches.

At the Zuckerman Institute, I am a co-organizer of the <a href="https://motorcontrol.zi.columbia.edu/events"> ZMBBI Motor Club </a> and the <a href="https://zuckermaninstitute.columbia.edu/growing-science"> Growing up in Science </a> series.
